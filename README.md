# Propensify: Propensity Model to Identify Customer Response to Marketing Campaigns

## Project Overview

Propensify is a machine learning project aimed at developing a propensity model to forecast the likelihood that specific customer groups will respond positively to a marketing campaign. By leveraging historical data provided by an insurance company, the model seeks to optimize marketing efforts by identifying potential customers who are more likely to engage with the company's services.

## Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to predict customer behavior accurately, despite investing heavily in data-driven marketing strategies. The challenge lies in effectively utilizing customer data to make informed decisions. Propensity modeling helps in addressing this challenge by using statistical analysis to forecast customer actions based on various influencing factors. This project involves building a propensity model for an insurance company to optimize their marketing campaigns.

## Data Description

The project utilizes two datasets:

*   **Train Dataset (`train.csv`):** Historical customer data used for training the model.
*   **Test Dataset (`test.csv`):** Data of potential customers for whom the likelihood of engagement needs to be predicted.

*(Note: Only focus on relevant columns as specified in the project instructions.)*

## Project Workflow

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    *   **Objective:** Understand the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends.
    *   **Methods:** Descriptive statistics, visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices).

2.  **Data Cleaning**

    *   **Objective:** Prepare the data for modeling by ensuring its quality.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Handle missing values.
        *   Standardize data formats.
        *   Identify and manage outliers.

3.  **Dealing with Imbalanced Data**

    *   **Objective:** Address the class imbalance to ensure the model does not favor the majority class.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Oversampling (e.g., SMOTE).
        *   Undersampling.
        *   Use of class weights in modeling.

4.  **Feature Engineering**

    *   **Objective:** Enhance the dataset by creating new features or transforming existing ones.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Generate interaction terms.
        *   Apply normalization or scaling.
        *   Encode categorical variables.

5.  **Model Selection**

    *   **Objective:** Identify the most suitable machine learning algorithms for the problem.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Compare various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
        *   Use cross-validation to assess model performance.

6.  **Model Training**

    *   **Objective:** Train the selected model(s) on the training dataset.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Split data into training and validation sets.
        *   Train the model using the training set.
        *   Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

7.  **Model Validation**

    *   **Objective:** Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   Accuracy
        *   Precision
        *   Recall
        *   F1 Score
        *   ROC-AUC

8.  **Model Deployment**

    *   **Objective:** Deploy the trained model to a production environment for real-time predictions.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Save the trained model.
        *   Develop an API or web interface for predictions.
        *   Monitor the model's performance in production.

## Tools and Technologies

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `imbalanced-learn`
*   **Version Control:** GitHub
*   **Deployment:** Streamlit, Flask, or similar framework for web deployment

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for optimizing marketing campaigns through propensity modeling. By accurately predicting customer engagement, the insurance company can enhance its marketing efficiency and resource allocation.
